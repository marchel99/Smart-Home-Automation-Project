**Overview**

This home automation project uses Arduino and Raspberry Pi to automate various devices in your home, including entry gates, outside lights, and lights inside your home. In addition, you can also use the project to manage a video intercom system that allows you to communicate with visitors at your door.

The Arduino board controls the physical devices in your home, such as the gates and lights, while the Raspberry Pi serves as a hub to receive commands from the web app and communicate with the Arduino. The web app is a user interface that allows you to control the devices in your home using a computer or mobile device. It is built with JavaScript and runs on the Raspberry Pi.

To set up and use the project, you will need an Arduino board, a Raspberry Pi board, a breadboard and jumper wires, relays to control the devices, and a web browser to access the web app. Once the project is set up, you can use the web app to turn on and off the devices in your home, communicate with visitors at your door through the video intercom, and enjoy the convenience of automated home devices.

To run this home automation project, you will need the following:

    An Arduino board
    A Raspberry Pi board
    A breadboard and jumper wires
    Relays to control the devices
    A web browser to access the web app

**Setup**

To set up this home automation project, follow these steps:

    Connect the Arduino to the Raspberry Pi using a USB cable.
    Connect the relays to the Arduino and the devices you want to control.

    Run the web app and connect to it using a web browser.

**Usage**

To use this home automation project, follow these steps:

    Open the web app in your web browser.
    Use the interface to turn on and off the devices in your home.
    Enjoy the convenience of automated home devices!

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter any issues with this home automation project, try the following:

    Make sure all connections are secure and properly connected.
    Check that the Arduino and Raspberry Pi are communicating with each other.
    Check that the relays are properly connected to the devices you want to control.
    Ensure that the web app is properly set up and running on the Raspberry Pi.

**Conclusion**

This home automation project allows you to automate the devices in your home using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, and control them using a JavaScript web app. With this project, you can enjoy the convenience of automated home devices and control them from anywhere in your home or remotely.
